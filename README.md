# welcome to excalibrr

Hi! This is our second markdown file, but I believe in the near future there will be a third. :)

**excalibrr** is Gravitate's React Component library. It has two main purposes:

- Giving developers powerful contexts to cut out the boilerplate of
  getting a fully fledged React site up and running.
- Useful building block components that minimize custom CSS and
  rebuilding the wheel.

# usage

If you're one of the 'cool kids' (added to gravitates npm package account) you can install the package.

    yarn add @gravitate-js/excalibrr

## coming soon

We have big plans for excalibrr. upcoming we have:

> **Storybook Documentation:** Living and breathing documentation for our component library.
> **Demo Site** - site showing off excalibrr fully set up.
> **More Helpful Contexts** - we are currently building a theme context, navigation context, and auth context.
